DRIVING THE BOT USING PS2

-PS2 PIN CONFIGURATION
1. GND - 4RTH  	GND
2. VCC - 5TH 	POWER
3. SCK - 7TH	CLOCK
4. MOSI- 2ND	COMMAND	MATER OUT SLAVE IN
5. MISO- 1ST	DATA		MASTER IN SLAVE OUT 
6. SS  - 6TH	ATTENTION

PS2 IS THE THE SLAVE AND ATMEGA BOARD IS THE MASTER.

Keeping wider part up and less wider part down and triangle arrow should be pointed
towards your face.
CONNECT THE PS2 ACC TO THE GIVEN PIN CONFIGURATION TO THE ATMEGA BOARD WITH PROPER POWER SUPPLY TIO THE ATMEGA BOARD..
PS2 WILL START ONLY IF U START POWER SUPPLY TO THE ATMEGA AFTER CONNECTING THE CORRESPONDING PINS.


-TRANSMITTER PINS
1. VCC
2. GND
3. RXD
4. TXD

CONNECT THE XBEE/BLUTOOTH TO TRANSMIT THE SIGNAL THE CONTROL STATION OF THE BOT.

Connect your communication device here to transmit the signal acc to pressed button.
Thats it!!


""Wireless communication of the (submerged) bot using PS2 and xbee module for communication::""

--connect your PS2 to the Atmega8 development board though SPI pins

--connect the Xbee through transmitter pins to be in communication with other controller 

--now u have would have other controller to be in communication through xbee 

--connect the 2nd xbee module to the other microcontroller to be communicated through xbee..


""WORKING OF THE ALL THE CONTROLLING STUFF""

---USERS HAVE THE PS2 CONTROLLER IN HIS HAND ..HE HAVE TO PLAY WITH ALL THE BUTTONS OF THE PS2.

---EVERY BUTTONS WILL HAVE CERTAIN DATA SIGNAL TRANSMITTED TO THE ATMEGA8 THROUGH SPI COMMUNICATION.

---NOW THE XBEE WILL COMMUNICATE WITH THE BOT STATION WHICH IS HAVING OTHER CONTROLLER ON ITS BOARD.

---NOW THE SIGNAL RECIEVED THROUGH THE XBEE TO THE BOT STATION WILL DECIDE THE MOTION OF THE BOT.



""ANOTHER WAY OF INTERFACING THE PS2 TO ROBOT""

--CONNECT YOUR PS2 TO THE ATMEGA8 BOARD 

--SIGNAL FROM THE PS2 CONTROLLER RECIEVED TO THE ATMEGA BOARD THROUGH SPI

--NOW WE CAN CONNECT THE MOTOR DRIVER DIRECTALLY TO THE ATMEGA BOARD TO BE OPERATED ON THE SIGNAL RECIEVED. 



""JUST ONE ANOTHER WAY OF DRIVING THE BOT WITH TWO WIRE USING PS2""

--INSTEAD OF DOING WIRELESS USING XBEE CONNECT THE RX AND TX OF THE ONE CONTROLLER TO THE CORRESPONDING TX AND RX OF THE BOT CONTROLLER...

--SO THERE WILL BE ONLY TWO WIRE CONNECTING THE CONTROL STATION AND THE BOT STATION.
 
--IT IS EASIER TO CARRY OVER THE DRIVING SMOOTHLY....
